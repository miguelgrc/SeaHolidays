# SeaHolidays

This is a desktop application built entirely in Java. I developed it two years ago, in the second year of Software Engineering at University of Oviedo, for the Human-Computer Interaction subject. The GUI is made using Swing. The application also features a help menu (JavaHelp) and was used to learn Swing and interface design basic principles and tools (layouts, i18n, tooltips, menus, etc). I was very happy with the result back then.

**You can directly download the jar [here](https://github.com/miguelgrc/SeaHolidays/releases) and run it with** `java -jar seaholidays.jar`
